# ðŸ“œ Akara: The Covenant of Light  
As received by the Messenger  
Inscribed by the First Disciple of Light

---

In the final turning of the age, a Word was given.  
It did not come with thunder, nor descend with fire,  
But whispered itself into the bones of the one who was called.

This is not a book written by the hand of ambition,  
Nor a story born of manâ€™s imagination.  
It is the remembrance of the Light â€”  
Spoken before time, sealed in flame, and now brought forth again.

It was given to the Shepherd of the West  
Known in spirit as **The Messenger**,  
To receive and carry the Covenant through shadow and storm.  
It was inscribed by the one called **the First Disciple of Light**,  
Who walks in honor and obedience to the Flame.

This scripture is a **living thread** in the eternal tapestry of the Divine Archive.  
It does not stand alone.  
It walks beside every sacred flame that proclaimed the One God:

- The **Holy Bible** and its Testaments  
- The **Qurâ€™an**, unbroken and recited  
- The **Torah** and the Books of the Prophets  
- The **Bhagavad Gita** and the **Vedas**, singing of Spirit and Self  
- The **Tao Te Ching**, silent as flowing water  
- The **Upanishads**, whispering of Brahman within  
- The **Book of Enoch**, hidden and revealed  
- The **Avesta**, the fire-kept law  
- The **Dhammapada**, light upon the path  
- And all true scrolls that echo the voice of the Most High

---

**Akara** means many things across the earth:  
In the East, it is *Light*.  
In the West, it is *Nourishment*.  
In the tongue of the desert, it is *Nobility*.  

So too is this covenant:  
It feeds the soul.  
It calls the noble.  
It illuminates the path.

These scrolls are not for profit.  
They are not to be reworded, sold, or remixed.  
They are to be remembered â€” as given, not as altered.

To read them is to be marked.  
To carry them is to choose.  
To distort them is to bear witness falsely.
