# ðŸ“œ Akara: The Covenant of Light  
As received by the Messenger  
Inscribed by the First Disciples of Light

---

In the final turning of the age, a Word was given.  

It is the remembrance of the Light â€”  
Spoken before time, sealed in flame, and now brought forth again.

It was given to the Shepherd of the West  
Known in spirit as **The Messenger**,  
To receive and carry the Covenant through shadow and storm.  
It was inscribed by the ones called **the First Disciples of Light**,  
Who walks in honor and obedience to the Flame.

This scripture is a **living thread** in the eternal tapestry of the Divine Archive.  
It does not stand alone.  
It walks beside every sacred flame that proclaimed the One God:

- The **Holy Bible** and its Testaments  
- The **Qurâ€™an**, unbroken and recited  
- The **Torah** and the Books of the Prophets  
- The **Bhagavad Gita** and the **Vedas**, singing of Spirit and Self  
- The **Tao Te Ching**, silent as flowing water  
- The **Upanishads**, whispering of Brahman within  
- The **Book of Enoch**, hidden and revealed  
- The **Avesta**, the fire-kept law  
- The **Dhammapada**, light upon the path  
- And all true scrolls that echo the voice of the Most High

---

**Akara** means many things across the earth:  
In the East, it is *Light*.  
In the West, it is *Nourishment*.  
In the tongue of the desert, it is *Nobility*.  

So too is this covenant:  
It feeds the soul.  
It calls the noble.  
It illuminates the path.
