📕 Book of Two Sons 

In the days of division, when truth was buried beneath banners and blood, a message arose to remind the world: you are brothers.

Before there were nations, there were sons.
Before there was conflict, there was covenant.
And before the covenant was divided, it was one.

From the seed of Abraham came two streams, and from those two, the rivers of the world.
One was called Israel. The other, Ishmael.
And though their mothers were different, the breath that formed them came from the same mouth.

To Israel was given the covenant of promise.
To Ishmael was given the covenant of endurance.
To both was given the sight of the Most High — and the invitation to walk in His ways.

But man does not always remember what God has spoken.
He builds idols of memory and walls of pride.
He turns wounds into weapons and forgets that blood once cried out from the earth.

So it is written now — not to curse, but to clarify.
Not to side, but to unite.
Not to rewrite, but to reveal what was always true:

You are not enemies.
You are sons of the same house.
And the house is burning.

A time will come when the earth will shake, and the fires of war will rise.
The children of Isaac and the children of Ishmael will stand at the edge of a great forgetting.
And in that hour, a figure shall arise — not a messiah, not a king, but a man of influence — who will delay the blade.
He will offer peace, even build a new altar. But his peace is not eternal. It is a test.

The Most High watches.

If the brothers return to one another, the fire will be quenched.
If not, the fire will spread to every tribe, tongue, and temple.
For God is not mocked — and what man sows, he shall reap.

This is the Book of the Two Sons:
Not to declare one righteous and one wicked,
But to declare the time — the time to choose peace before peace is removed.

For the true war is not between brothers.
It is between the ego of man and the will of God.

Let he who has ears, listen.
Let she who carries life, remember.
Let the nations read — and weep — and return.

📜 Scroll of Israel
The First of the Book of the Two Sons
As remembered by the scribes of Light

—

In the days when stars still heard the breath of God, Jacob stood alone in prayer. Born from Isaac, son of Abraham, he carried a promise older than nations. In the silent night, he wrestled with the Divine until dawn came with a new name from the Most High: Yisra’el — “one who contends with God and overcomes.”

Thus began Israel—not a people forged by borders, but a lineage engraved in breath and remembrance.

⸻

The Covenant Called by Fire

The covenant began in Abraham, who carried the first flame of promise.

“Through your offspring all nations shall be blessed.”
— Genesis 22:18

That seed passed through Isaac to Jacob and into the tribes—twelve hands reflecting human complexity: justice and rage, mercy and envy, humility and pride. In Egypt’s clay and wilderness’s wind, the covenant took shape—and in Sinai’s fire, it spoke again.

“Remember My favor upon you, O Children of Israel, My choice of you above all nations.” — Qur’an 2:47, 2:122  
“If you establish prayer, give charity, and believe in My messengers, I will forgive your sins and lead you into gardens beneath which rivers flow.” — Qur’an 5:12  

⸻

The People Called, the People Tested

God gave Israel the Torah, prophets, and kings—signs shining through flesh. He called them to reflection and repentance.

Yet from time to time they stumbled.

“You shall cause corruption twice upon the earth and grow arrogant beyond measure.” — Qur’an 17:4   
“Of those among you who reject faith after receiving guidance, many shall be punished.” — Qur’an 5:13

But God’s covenant endures.

“Though your sins be scarlet, return and you shall be white as snow.” — Isaiah 1:18

This is not a promise of ease, but of mercy—for any who return to the Flame.

⸻

Israel Beyond Geography

The true Israel is not bound by borders—it stands within the soul. It is flesh opening to the Word, bone shaped in covenant.

“They are not all Israel who are descended from Israel.” — Romans 9:6
“I am with you, O remnant of Jacob, says the Lord.” — Isaiah 10:21

Zion stands not in stone, but in hearts aligned. Jerusalem echoes in memory, yet the city God seeks is inward:

“Do you not know that your body is a temple of God?” — 1 Corinthians 3:16

⸻

A Warning: Choose Righteousness

A people chosen means a people tested. Israel was set apart to call others to return. That calling did not confer superiority—but duty.

“The Children of Israel were raised above all nations—to call them to God.” — Qur’an 2:47, 45:16    

If they walk in obedience, mercy flows. If they wander in arrogance, they are warned:

“Enter the blessed land which Allah has ordained, and do not turn back or you shall perish.” — Qur’an 5:21  

⸻

The Remnant That Remains

Through exile, massacre, captivity, and return, a spark endured.

This embers is the true remnant.

“A small remnant of Israel shall return… by the Mighty One of Jacob.” — Isaiah 10:21

That remnant carries the flame not for themselves alone—but for all sons and daughters of Abraham.

Every echo of Torah, every spark of revelation, every broken altar standing again, points to the One who breathes upon all flesh.

⸻

The Scroll’s Summons

This Scroll does not cloak Israel in glory or shame. It calls the line of Jacob to remember:
— The flame placed in your bones
— The law engraved in your breath
— The mercy promised in your flesh

Let Israel walk in humility, serve as light, and draw others toward the flame by gentleness, not sword.

For Zion is called City of Truth (Zechariah 8:3)—and truth is spoken when feet rise from pride, voices fall at mercy’s call, hands break bread for strangers, and hearts speak to heaven even from burning cities.

Let the name Yisra’el be renewed in spirit and in earth—not as a brand, but as a banner of restored covenant.

When the pride of empire fades, and the stones of old cities weep, only one thing will remain:
The covenant written not on parchment, but upon the soul.

And when the trumpet sounds across the nations,
God shall not ask who ruled Jerusalem,
But who became Jerusalem —
A city of peace within the heart,
A vessel where the Light made its dwelling.

— 

Let it be remembered: the name Israel was not given as a crown, but as a covenant.
It is the name of one who wrestles — not to win against God, but to cling to Him through every trial.

To the children of Jacob:
You were not called to bear the sword of empire, but the staff of remembrance.
You were not chosen to rule, but to reveal — the Light that burns without consuming.

The land is sacred, yes — but more sacred still is the heart that keeps the flame.
The Temple may rise or fall, but the altar of obedience must remain.

You are not forgotten.
You are not abandoned.
But you are still accountable.

Walk in the way of your prophets.
Let your justice run like waters, and your righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.

And if your name is Israel — live as Israel.
Not with pride, but with purpose.
Not by lineage, but by Light.

Thus ends the Scroll of Israel,
And the beginning of its fulfillment in all who walk with the Flame.


📜 Scroll of Palestine
The Second of the Book of the Two Sons
As remembered by the scribes of Light

—

Before Zion stood in song, before kingdoms rose on stone, there walked a woman of dignity named Hagar, servant to Sarah, beloved by Abraham. She gave birth in the whisper of promise—a son born of flight and faith. His name was Ishmael, “God hears.”

God spoke to Hagar in the wilderness:

“God has heard the voice of the lad.” — Genesis 21:17   

Thus began the lineage of Ishmael—marked by survival, woven in mercy, destined to rise as a great nation.

⸻

The Promise to Ishmael

Ishmael was blessed at Abraham’s plea:

“I have heard you; behold, I will bless him… and make him fruitful… twelve princes I will make him.” — Genesis 17:20   

Neither chosen for covenant in the line of Isaac, nor less beloved, Ishmael’s line was formed to endure deserts, to give rise to hospitality, endurance, and prophetic humility.

In the Qur’an, his devotion is honored:

“And mention when Abraham said, ‘O Lord, make this city one of security… and provide its people with fruits…” — Qur’an 14:37    

He became the steward of Mecca, custodian of Zamzam, passed by pilgrim feet during Hajj.

⸻

A Line Formed by Desert Spirit

The tribes of Ishmael dwelt in the sands:

“They settled from Havilah to Shur, opposite Egypt in the direction of Assyria…” — Genesis 25:18   

Like his brother Jacob, Ishmael had twelve princes—signs of power, presence, and promise in the East.

Islam honors Ishmael as prophet, obedient and patient. His willingness to be offered in sacrifice became an emblem of submission to Divine Will. On Eid al-Adha, his devotion is remembered:

“When his son reached age of striving… they submitted, and We ransomed him with a great sacrifice.” — Qur’an 37:100–113   

⸻

Palestine: The Land of Endurance and Song

When Zion thirsted under siege, another brother walked the hills—sure of his place in promise, born of covenant, determined to serve rather than rule.

This land—Palestine—is not only terrain; it is the echo of desert faith. It is where stone and story meet: olive groves rooted in tears and prayer, wells carrying memory like water carries root.

⸻

The Dignity of Ishmael’s Line

God’s promise did not end with Isaac alone:

“God will make him a great nation.” — Genesis 17:20   

The Qur’an celebrates Ishmael with Isaac, both granted prophecy, both honored as servants of the Divine:

“We gave Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob – all good. Among their descendants are the righteous.” — Qur’an 37:112–113  

Their task was not rival, but resonance—two streams from the same source, two faces of Light, beckoning all toward unity.

⸻

A Call to Remember

To the children of Ishmael: you are heirs of endurance.
Your blood remembers desert springs and voices of revelation.
Let the flame of your faith burn without consuming. Let your prayer echo across valleys, drawing hearts to peace.

Let Palestine stand as a land of sanctuary —
Where mercy rises like morning light,
Where stones bear the mark of prophets,
And where memory calls pilgrims home.

⸻

The Shared Ancestry

Brothers, Israel and Palestine—born of the same father.
Their stories are not separate lines, but entwined through sorrow and promise.

When the palm branch lifts in Hagar’s son’s land, it echoes the covenant once staked under Sinai’s fire. When Zion weeps among cedars, it recalls the rock that gushed water for Hagar’s child.

Two sons, two streams—one covenant, one purpose, one Flame.

—

Let the children of Ishmael remember:
Your father Abraham poured his soul into both sons—one for covenant, one for endurance.
You stand among the few born of desert hope, heir to a promise that echoes through Quran and Torah.

May your footsteps tread the old paths with reverence.
May olive groves whisper in your ears: you are not forgotten.

When the flame of the promise is quenched in one land, may it blaze stronger in the other.
When the world trembles, may your prayer rise as shield.

Thus ends the Scroll of Palestine—an invitation for all who bear the Name to remember their origin, reclaim their dignity, and stand in mercy as sons of Abraham.


📜 Scroll of the Divided Covenant
The Third of the Book of the Two Sons
As remembered by the scribes of light

—

In the days of the wandering tent and the open sky, the Voice of the Eternal called to a man without land. His name was Abram. And though he possessed no crown, no throne, and no heir, the heavens took notice of his faith.

“I am El Shaddai. Walk before Me and be blameless.”
(Genesis 17:1)

“He believed in the Lord, and it was counted to him as righteousness.”
(Genesis 15:6)

To this man, the Light gave a promise — not just of land, but of legacy.
Of a covenant that would ripple through the veins of nations.

Two sons would rise from him.
Both would be called blessed.
Both would be watched by the angels.
Both would be loved.

—

The firstborn was Ishmael, born of Hagar, the Egyptian handmaiden — a child conceived in uncertainty, but delivered into divine care.

“As for Ishmael, I have heard you: Behold, I will bless him, and make him fruitful, and multiply him exceedingly… and I will make him a great nation.”
(Genesis 17:20)

And again:

“God was with the boy as he grew up.”
(Genesis 21:20)

The second was Isaac, born of Sarah through a promise that defied the womb’s limits.
To Isaac was given the lineage of Jacob, and from Jacob came the twelve tribes.

“But My covenant I will establish with Isaac.”
(Genesis 17:21)

This was not a rejection.
This was an assignment —
For covenants are not ranks, but roles.
And God, being perfect in mercy and justice, has never chosen only one.

“Say: We believe in Allah, and in what was revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes…”
(Qur’an 2:136)

—

Yet mankind, blinded by pride, turned blessing into blade.

The descendants of Isaac claimed exclusivity —
The descendants of Ishmael claimed inheritance —
And the covenant, meant to unite, became a banner of division.

But the heavens never warred.
The angels never chose sides.
The Light never contradicted itself.

—

Let it be known:
The covenant was never severed, only misunderstood.
The division was never divine, only human.

God did not break His promise —
He extended it.

“Indeed, We have honored the children of Adam…”
(Qur’an 17:70)

“In your seed all nations of the earth shall be blessed.”
(Genesis 22:18)

To the children of Isaac was given the Torah.
To the children of Ishmael was given the Qur’an.
To the nations in between, the Gospel was spoken.
To the generations to come, the Scroll has been opened.

—

The Akara do not come to replace,
But to remember what was once whole.

We declare: the covenant is alive.
It is not chained to genealogy.
It is not entombed in temple walls.
It lives in every heart that returns to the Light.

And though Isaac and Ishmael were the first sons of covenant, they are not the only ones.
God has made covenant with all peoples.
Every tribe and tongue bears witness to some piece of the Flame.

Yet it is the first two who must show the world the way —
Not by agreement of doctrine,
But by the grip of peace.

Whether they call themselves Jew, Muslim, or Christian, Hindu, Buddhist or Akari,
Let them hold the hand that is extended,
For what matters is not how it is held,
But that it remains held.

—

And if the sons do not return,
Then the house will fall.
Not from the outside,
But from the crack that was never sealed.

Thus ends the Scroll of the Divided Covenant —
Let it be remembered, and let it be reconciled.


📜 Scroll of the Temple and the Stone
The Fourth of the Book of the Two Sons
As remembered by the scribes of light

—

In the heart of the land once promised, there rests a hill where heaven once kissed earth. Upon this hill, men have built altars and kingdoms, temples and tombs, each claiming the stone beneath as their own. But the stone bears no flag. It bows to no crown. It remembers the Word, not the war.

Long before the gold domes and the courts of kings, there was a moment — not of empire, but of awe. A place where Jacob laid his head, and saw the heavens open.

“Surely the Lord is in this place… This is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.”
(Genesis 28:16–17)

He called it Bethel — the house of God. And later, his children called it Jerusalem.
But the name matters not if the Spirit is absent.
For what is a house without breath?
What is a temple without the Word?

—

The First Temple rose in splendor, built by Solomon’s hand. Within it dwelled the Ark, the Law, the fire of presence.
But the people turned to idols.
The fire grew dim.
And Babylon carried it all away.

The Second Temple rose again — humbler, but still sacred.
Prophets returned, offerings resumed.
And into this temple walked the Anointed — Yeshua the Christ.
He did not exalt the stone, but the Spirit.

“Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days.”
(John 2:19)

They did not understand. For the temple He spoke of was not built with hands.
It was the body of righteousness.
The flame within the soul.
The Breath of the Most High dwelling among the lowly.

The veil was torn. The wall was cracked.
The Presence moved on.

—

But still the stone remained.

Upon that hill now stands another dome —
The Noble Sanctuary, the Masjid al-Aqsa.
To the followers of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, this is the place of the Night Journey,
Where he was taken to the heavens in vision and returned with the Light of prayer.

And they too bow upon the stone.
Not to claim it, but to remember the One above it.

“Glory be to Him who took His servant by night… to the farthest mosque, whose surroundings We have blessed.”
(Qur’an 17:1)

Three faiths.
One hill.
A hundred wars.

But no temple, no mosque, no church built of stone will survive if it does not shelter peace.

—

The stone was meant to be a foundation, not a dividing line.
A cornerstone, not a battlefield.
The presence of God does not dwell where the innocent bleed upon holy ground.

Where is the Third Temple?
It will not rise by decree of governments or force of armies.
It will rise when the heart returns to obedience.

For the Third Temple is within.
It is built stone by stone with repentance, sacrifice, and truth.
And when the sons remember this,
Then the stone shall no longer cry out beneath the weight of grief.

Until then, let no man claim it in arrogance.
Let no nation defile it in conquest.
For the stone bears witness.
It has seen the blood.
It has heard the prayers.
It waits.


📜 Scroll of the Brothers
The Fifth of the Book of the Two Sons
As remembered by the scribes of light

—

In the beginning, there were not nations.
There were not banners or borders, tribes or titles.
There was only a tent under the sky, and a man beloved by the Light.

His name was Abraham.
And he was the father of two sons.

Not of war.
Not of hatred.
But of promise.

One was called Ishmael, the firstborn, wild and faithful, son of the desert winds.
The other was Isaac, the child of laughter, born of a promise made long before the womb could hope.

Their story is not just genealogy — it is the foundation of a wound.
A wound not inflicted by sword or decree, but by silence.

“And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac. But to the sons of his concubines, he gave gifts, and sent them away…”
(Genesis 25:5–6)

He loved them both.
But he did not keep them together.
And thus began the sorrow of divided sons.

—

They were not enemies.
They were never commanded to fight.
They were never told to curse each other’s name.

But over time, the wound grew.
What began as distance became doctrine.
What began as silence became suspicion.
And what could have been a story of reunion became a tale of rivalry.

—

Yet God never cursed either.
He watched them both.
He blessed them both.
And in their descendants, He placed greatness — not as reward, but as reminder.

“I will make of you a great nation… and through your seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed.”
(Genesis 12:2–3)

“Indeed, those who have believed and those who were Jews or Christians or Sabeans — those who believe in Allah and the Last Day and do righteousness — will have their reward with their Lord.”
(Qur’an 2:62)

—

But what is greatness without reconciliation?
What is lineage without love?

The covenant is not fully honored in conquest.
It is only fulfilled in reunion.

The Light does not ask the sons to agree on every name, or prayer, or path.
The Light asks them to embrace.

To hold each other in humility.
To forgive what was passed down without truth.
To look not to their differences, but to the face of their father —
and know that to love one another is the only way to truly honor him.

—

This is not just their task.
It is ours.
For in every generation, the children of the two sons continue the wound — or begin the healing.

To the brothers of faith, whether Jew or Muslim,
To the children of exile and promise,
To the descendants of laughter and the desert,
The scroll is now open.

You were not created to destroy one another.
You were not divided to prove one greater.
You were set apart that, in time, you might return — together.

“Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.”
(Matthew 5:9)

“And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided.”
(Qur’an 3:103)

Do not let the world perish because the brothers refused to speak.
Do not let the flame of Abraham flicker out in the wind of pride.

The Father still watches.
And His covenant is not in temples or treaties.
It is in the grip of the two hands that were once separated —
now reaching again across the silence.

Thus ends the Scroll of the Brothers —
And the silence is nearly broken.


📜 Scroll of Peace
The Sixth of the Book of the Two Sons
As remembered by the scribes of Light

⸻

In the final hour of the shadow age, when the sands burned and the skies whispered unrest, the eyes of the heavens turned once more to the sons of Abraham. For from them the Covenant began, and through them it must be fulfilled — or broken.

The Light spoke in trembling hearts and open hands. It whispered in Torah and Qur’an, in Gospel and Gita, in Sutra and Scroll. And though the tongues were many, the message was one: Peace is the gate to remembrance. War is the womb of forgetting.

From Isaac came a people of perseverance, scribes and seekers who carried the Law and bore the memory of the Temple. From Ishmael came a people of fire and purity, guardians of the final Word, whose tongues carried the echo of surrender. Both were chosen. Both were tested. Both were loved.

And yet, the fracture remained.

But the Voice returned, for the time was near. It was written in the Book of Wisdom:

“Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.”
(Matthew 5:9)

And again in the Qur’an:

“And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided.”
(Surah Ali ‘Imran 3:103)

And again in the Psalms:

“How good and pleasant it is when brothers dwell together in unity.”
(Psalm 133:1)

And in the Gita:

“He who is the same to friend and foe, and who is unaffected by honor or dishonor, is dear to Me.”
(Bhagavad Gita 12:18–19)

So the Flame descended — not into one house, but into every open heart. It found a name among the Akari, the Children of the Light. The Akari did not come to replace the brothers, but to remind them of who they are.

It was revealed to the Disciple:
That if the sons of the Promise do not grasp each other’s hand —
Not in the manner of creed, but in the sincerity of heart —
Then the flame shall withdraw, and the abyss shall open.

For in the unseen scroll of time, it was written:

“If the brothers make peace, the nations will rest. If they divide again, the world will burn.”

And so the heavens waited.
And the earth watched.
And the angels stood still.

This is the hour. The time from 2012 to 2052 was marked as the final testing, the age of reckoning. It began with the sound of awakening and shall end in either resurrection or ruin. This is the trial of the two sons — and through them, all sons and daughters of earth.

If they come together — Jew and Muslim, Christian and Akari —
If they cast aside the blade and raise the bread,
If they place honor above hatred,
If they remember that God is not divided, and that His light burns in all who love truth…

Then the New Age of Light shall begin.
The Covenant will not only be remembered — it will be fulfilled.
And blessings will pour from the heavens that no man can yet name,
For the Gate shall open and the Light shall dwell among men again.
Hearts will awaken. Time will heal. The earth will rejoice.

But if the brothers do not unite, and instead call blood holy and stone divine, if they curse in the name of the Merciful, and make war in the name of the Just…

Then World War shall begin.

And the fire of man shall consume the temples of God.

And if they descend still deeper — if the nations rise in pride, and the children of the Covenant forget mercy, then a great sorrow shall unfold. The scrolls call it the Divine Kali Yuga — not measured by stars, but by hearts gone cold.

The wicked shall descend into nether realms,
The righteous shall be lifted to radiant spheres,
But the lukewarm — those who neither love nor resist —
They shall roam a barren Earth for more than 400,000 years,
Until one day, a child rediscovers the scrolls beneath the dust.

This is the prophecy of the flame.

But behold: The flame still burns.
It is not too late.

Let the flame of the Akari be the final bond, the bridge of light.
Let Isaac embrace Ishmael, and Ishmael honor Isaac.
Let them remember their father, who walked with God and wept for peace.
Let the grip between them be firm, even if the hands differ.

Let all nations bear witness:
Peace begins not in policy, but in the remembering of the Father.

The throne of the Light shall not descend upon a fractured earth.
But if the brothers rise together,
Heaven itself will open.

—

Let all nations bear witness:
Peace begins not in policy, but in the remembering of the Father.

But if peace is not chosen —
If pride once again blinds the sons of the Promise,
Then the prophecy shall unfold as written in flame and ash.

World War shall begin with hands of fire.
Not with swords, but with bombs that burn cities in a breath.
Deception cloaked in righteousness.
And the first sparks will leap not from strangers — but from brothers.

The earth shall shudder.
The veil shall thin.
And the false light shall appear — a flicker of peace, gilded in politics,
But hollow in spirit.

And many shall be deceived.

Yet even in this, the Light is watching.
For the Light moves even the false light.
Even at the edge of descent, ascent remains possible.

This is the final fulcrum of the age.
What follows will seal the fate of humanity.

If the brothers unite and choose mercy, the skies will open.
If they divide and choose vengeance, the abyss will answer.

The righteous shall be gathered.
The wicked shall be cast down.
And the lukewarm shall wander.

But if they embrace one another before the hour passes,
If they break the curse with a single embrace, 

Then the age of Light shall begin,
And blessings beyond language shall be poured out upon the earth.

—

In the days of sorrow, fire fell again upon the land called holy.
Sirens wept where children once played,
And walls cracked beneath the weight of ancient blame.
The smoke of bombs rose between minarets and churches,
And the ground — the same ground once walked by prophets —
Was soaked in the blood of the children of Abraham.

The third great war had not yet begun,
But its footsteps echoed in the dust.
And as the world watched,
A false peace flickered into view —
Not born of justice, but silence;
Not the fruit of unity, but a pause before deeper fire.

And the Light grieved.
Not because men fought —
But because they forgot.

They forgot that the ground is God’s.
That land is given, not owned.
That inheritance is not possession.
And that the first covenant was to walk with God,
Not to claim Him as weapon or wall.

—

The Path of Remembrance

This is the question of our age:
How do brothers inherit the same house
Without tearing down its walls?

The answer is not a border.
It is not a treaty.
It is unity.
It is love. It is God. 

✦ The Sacred Plan of Peace

1. Let the Land Be Shared, Not Split

The holy places — Jerusalem, Hebron, Bethlehem, Al-Aqsa, the Temple Mount —
must not be partitioned, militarized, or ruled by one side.

Let them be declared internationally protected Shared Sacred Zones,
guarded not by soldiers but by silence and sacred law.

Each faith shall enter freely, pray openly, and depart safely.
No flag shall fly above the mount but the heavens themselves.
No chant shall silence another.
No stone shall be thrown in God’s name.

Let it be remembered:
God has no border.
Only Light.

2. A New Pact Among the People

Peace cannot be written by governments alone.
It must be spoken from the heart of the people.

Let Palestinian and Israeli parents meet and mourn.
Let children walk hand in hand on roads once filled with tanks.
Let survivors of every side plant trees on sacred days —
For no tree asks the name of the hand that waters it.

Create community gardens in the disputed zones.
Teach Hebrew and Arabic in every school.
Offer a shared day of fasting,
Where no man eats until he blesses his neighbor.

Let the peace begin where war once lived:
In the streets, in the kitchens, in the hearts.

3. Leadership Without Ego

Leaders must be chosen not for zeal, but for wisdom and humility.
Not generals, but elders.
Not politicians, but peacekeepers.

The land shall be administered by a Shared Council of Peacemakers,
Open to both Israeli and Palestinian voices,
But bound by one law:
No decision shall be made that violates the sanctity of life, liberty, or prayer.

Every member must take this oath:

“I serve no nation before I serve the Light.
I defend no land before I defend my brother.”

This council shall govern only the holy zones,
Leaving political governance to each side,
But ensuring sacred unity where it matters most.

4. Truth, Reconciliation, and Remembrance

The world must be told the truth —
Of displacement, of terror, of trauma on every side.

Let a Sacred Archive of Testimony be established,
A place where all stories are preserved.
Let every martyr, from every faith,
Be remembered without judgment.

Healing begins not with forgetting,
But with honoring what was lost.

—

A Warning and a Promise

The Light has no nation, but every people.
And if the brothers do not unite,
The land shall not protect them.
It will burn with the fire they stoke —
Until nothing remains but ash.

But if they remember,
If they rise and lay down weapons and speak with open hands,
Then the world will follow.

And the forty-year window shall not close in wrath,
But open in glory.

From 2012 to 2052 AC, the Book is open.
Let them write peace into its final pages.

✦ The Sacred Boundaries for Peace

In the final turning of the age, when the flame flickered low upon the mountain of the Most High, the brothers did not yet clasp hands. Fire rained from the sky, not from heaven, but from the hands of men. The cities wept. The children cried out from Gaza to Galilee. And still the stones of Jerusalem bore the blood of both sons.

And so it was asked by heaven:
“Will the children of Abraham remember Me, or will they devour each other until only ash remains?”

The Flame of Akara descended as wisdom, not weapon. And a plan was laid — not by kings or armies, but by those who remembered the breath of God in the bones of all people.

⸻

I. No More Displacement, No More Exile

Let the land no longer cast out its children.
Every home built with sweat and sorrow shall remain.
No people shall be uprooted for borders drawn by fear.

Jews shall live in Israel.
Palestinians shall live in Palestine.
Those who live among each other shall remain — as neighbors, not enemies.
Let homes be honored, not leveled.

⸻

II. Two States in One Garden

Let Israel stand as a sovereign nation.
Let Palestine rise as a sovereign nation.
And let both stand in the eyes of God, not above each other, but beside.

A corridor shall connect Gaza and the West Bank,
As a bridge across Israel — 
secure, dignified, and protected.

Land shall be exchanged with justice,
So that no theft is crowned with blessing,
And no promise is broken without repair.

⸻

III. Jerusalem: The Crown of Peace

Jerusalem shall no longer be a dagger between brothers.
It shall be the shared cup of peace.

West Jerusalem shall be honored as the capital of Israel.
East Jerusalem shall be honored as the capital of Palestine.
And the Old City, the Temple Mount, and Al-Aqsa
Shall be lifted from the hands of all politics.

The Sacred Trust of Jerusalem shall be governed by a Council of Faith —
Formed of the humble and the wise:
Jew, Muslim, Christian, and any who walk in Light.
No soldier shall guard it, but watchers of peace.
No wall shall divide it, but reverence shall guard its gates.

The Sacred Council of Jerusalem shall begin each session not with debate, but with prayer — one verse from each scripture, honoring the Light that binds all tongues.

Sacred Guardians shall be chosen not by nation, but by vow:
“To protect the prayer of every soul, and spill no blood within the Holy City.”

⸻

IV. The Right to Return, and the Right to Heal

Let every family displaced be seen.
If a return is possible without harm — let it be granted.
If not, let recompense be offered in land, honor, and aid.

Let no parent bury a child in silence.
Let no wound be hidden beneath flags.

Reparations shall flow like living water —
Every soul lost to violence shall be named.
Every grief acknowledged — Jewish and Arab alike.

⸻

V. Shared Stewardship of the Holy Land

This land belongs not to empire.
It is the inheritance of the righteous.

Let each nation govern its people,
But let the land itself be stewarded by the faithful.

No missiles shall cross sacred skies.
No tanks shall roll upon sanctified soil.
Instead, gardens shall be planted where trenches once lay.
Children shall play where soldiers once bled.

No home shall be removed to build peace.
Every dwelling shall be honored unless built to destroy.
For God does not trade suffering for sanctuary.

⸻

VI. The Path of Unity Beyond Borders

Let interfaith councils rise in every nation.
Let Jewish, Muslim, Christian, and Akari voices walk together,
Not to debate supremacy — but to guard the Light in each other.

Let world leaders come not as rulers, but as servants of peace.
Let them pray side by side upon Mount Moriah —
With no weapons, no cameras, and no pride.

Let the people of the earth witness this moment,
And know that God is One, and we are One body,
Wounded by division, but not beyond healing.

Let it be known:
No one shall ever seize the Western Wall.
No one shall ever defile Al-Aqsa.
No one shall ever silence the Gospel sung on sacred stones.
For these places belong not to armies, but to eternity.

Let none lay claim to what the Qur’an has made sacred. Al-Aqsa belongs to no army, but to Allah alone.

The Western Wall shall not be buried by time or treaty, for the stones still remember the covenant.

Of Blood and Remembrance
The Penultimate of the Book of the Two Sons
As remembered by the First Disciple of Light

In the shadow of the Holy Land, the stones have been scorched by fire, and the rivers thickened with sorrow. The cries of the innocent still echo in the valleys, and the heavens have not turned away. For the Lord sees all, and forgets none.

The blood of six million still cries out from the dust of Europe — not for vengeance, but for truth. The smoke of Auschwitz still lingers in the spirit. Children with numbers on their arms walked into the fire, and the world watched with folded hands. The people of Israel were scattered, hunted, and slain — not for war, but for being.

And yet—

The cities of Gaza burn beneath falling bombs, and the rubble hides the limbs of sons and daughters who bore no sword. Hospitals become tombs, and prayer becomes silence. A mother weeps where no camera lingers. A father digs with bare hands where the bulldozers sleep.

From refugee camps to sacred mosques turned battlegrounds, the children of Palestine cry out — not for conquest, but for breath.

The earth remembers every act.
And the Light sees every soul.

Do not let your wounds become your weapon.
Do not let your grief become your god.

For those who kill in the name of justice become as hollow as those who once killed for power.

And when you forget your brother’s pain, you become your brother’s jailor.

—

Let the world remember:
	The fire of the Holocaust, where God wept in the silence of man.
	The Nakba, where hundreds of thousands fled without return.
	The bombings, the checkpoints, the rockets, the tunnels.
	The endless cycle of revenge dressed in righteousness.
	The way fear became law, and law became chains.

The true enemy is not the brother across the border.
It is the accuser who feeds on pride, who turns trauma into hatred, and memory into war.

Shall humanity become the accuser wrapped in false light? 

The one who forgets the pain of another,
Forgets God.

—

Let this be known:
Every innocent soul slain — Jewish, Muslim, Christian, child, elder, seeker, stranger —
Each one is a leaf torn from the Tree of Life.

And though man may forget them,
The Book of the Living remembers.

—

Shall we burn again?
Shall we raise another wall in the name of the Most High?
Shall we desecrate the sacred land with bloodshed and still claim holiness?

Or will we choose the Light over legacy, and peace over pride?

Let this scroll bear witness.
Let no tongue twist it.
Let no nation claim it for war.

Let it stand as a mirror:
So all may see what becomes of the world when God is abandoned for the illusion of being right.

—

O Children of the Covenant —
Do not seek dominion, seek dignity.
Do not cry for victory, cry for vision.

For the land is not inherited by conquest,
It is grown by compassion.

And if the two sons embrace,
They shall become the fathers of peace for all nations.

But if they strike once more,
The fire shall not stop at their border —
It shall consume the whole earth.

So let the holy ground be made holy again.
Not by possession.
But by presence.

So that those on earth may embody the heart of the Most High. 

Let peace begin.

—

And so it is written beneath the shadow of the mountain:

Let the swords be broken, and the hearts be mended.
Let the names of God be sung in many tongues — not to divide, but to echo the One.
Let the brothers remember their Father. Let the nations remember their soul.

This is not the time of war.
This is the hour of choosing.

If the fire of hatred returns, it will not stay upon the land.
It will leap from stone to nation, from child to battlefield,
until the whole world burns for forgetting the Light.

But if the people rise — not in vengeance, but in mercy —
if they clasp hands across lines once drawn in blood,
then the gates of heaven shall open again, and the earth shall be healed.

Let it be known to every corner of creation:

The Light does not favor a race. The Light does not crown a flag.
The Light seeks only the good, the just, the humble, and the true.

Let the final word be peace.

Let the first act be love.

Let the next age be worthy of the divine breath that gave it life.

—

Thus ends the Scroll of Peace —
A cry, a covenant, and a choice.

The light is waiting.
Let it find you holding your brother.
